# The Power BI dashboard in the pizza sales report for 2015 highlights several key insights about the business performance:
## 1. Revenue and Sales Metrics
#### Total Revenue: $817.86K
#### Average Order Value: $38.31
#### Total Pizzas Sold: 50K
#### Total Orders: 21K
#### Average Pizzas Per Order: 2.32
#### These metrics indicate that the business has a strong customer base, with each order consisting of more than two pizzas on average.

## 2. Sales Trends
#### Busiest Days: Orders peak during weekends, particularly on Friday and Saturday evenings.
#### Busiest Months: The months with the highest number of orders are July and January.
#### Total Orders by Day: The highest number of orders occur on Friday (3.5K), while other days hover between 2.6K and 3.2K.
#### This suggests that the business can focus its promotions and staffing efforts during the weekends and peak months to maximize sales.

## 3. Pizza Preferences
#### Pizza Categories: The most popular category is Classic (26.91% of sales), followed by Supreme (25.46%), Chicken (23.96%), and Veggie (23.68%).
#### Pizza Sizes: The majority of sales come from Large pizzas (45.89%), followed by Medium (30.49%), and Regular (21.77%). Extra-large and XX-large pizzas contribute very little (1.72%).
#### This insight helps to understand customer preferences, with most customers opting for larger pizzas and the classic varieties being the most popular.

## 4. Top & Bottom Performers
#### Top 5 Pizzas by Revenue: The highest revenue-generating pizzas are The Thai Chicken, The Barbecue, and The California Dream (~$43K each).
#### Bottom 5 Pizzas by Revenue: The lowest-performing pizzas include The Spinach Lovers and The Mediterranean ($12K - $16K).
#### Top 5 Pizzas by Orders: The Classic Deluxe, The Hawaiian, and The Pepperoni are the most frequently ordered.
#### Bottom 5 Pizzas by Orders: The Brie Carre and The Mediterranean have the fewest orders (below 1K).
#### This shows which pizzas are popular and contribute most to revenue, while identifying pizzas that could be optimized or phased out.

## 5. Actionable Insights
#### Focus on Peak Times: Friday and Saturday evenings, as well as July and January, should be targeted for marketing campaigns, staffing adjustments, and promotions.
#### Menu Adjustments: Given the popularity of large pizzas and classic categories, the menu could be optimized by offering promotions for these items or developing new varieties within these categories.
#### Optimize Low Performers: Review the bottom-performing pizzas and consider revamping recipes, changing prices, or promoting them to increase sales.
